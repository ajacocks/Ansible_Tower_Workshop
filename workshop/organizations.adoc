= Organizations

First delete the organization called `DEFAULT`.  Then, We will need to create a new Organization for our Lab today.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure to add your new Team to your new Organization!

==== Credentials

Credentials are what Ansible Tower uses to connect our automation to everything else. For our lab today we are going to set up 2 kinds of credentials.

===== AWS Credentials

Since this lab is in AWS we need to tell Ansible Tower how to connect. For this we create an AWS Credential. For the AWS information we create a user in IAM and give it the needed permissions. That information is available in the link:https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/[IAM Documentation].

[TIP]
.After saving the AWS credentials:
====
. Click the white 'PERMISSIONS' button
. Click the green '+Add' button
. Click 'TEAMS'
. Place a checkmark beside 'Lab-Team'
. Assign 'Use'
. Click 'Save'
====

===== Machine Credentials

Ansible uses ssh as the transport method. With that in mind, we need to give Ansible Tower the same ssh key(s) that AWS sets up on the system via cloud-init when it is provisioned.  First, delete the machine credential called `Demo Credential`.  Next, create the credential pictured, below.

. Click 'TEAMS'
. Place a checkmark beside 'Lab-Team'
. Assign 'Use'
. Click 'Save'

==== Last Word About Settings

When you have all of the information handy, like your SSH keys, Slack API Token, etc. the above works takes around 15-20 minutes to configure.

This can all also happen through the API or the command line using tower-cli on the Tower server or a remote server connecting back to the Tower server.
