= Exercise Four - Creating a Job Template

At this point, we can confidently navigate and have explored several of the major features of Ansible Tower. The final scripted exercise we have scheduled for today is going through the process around the creation of a Job Template.

Like we talked about earlier, a Job Template takes all of the other components that are tracked in Ansible Tower (inventory, project, playbook, and credentials) and brings them together into an executable package.

The thing that you have to do, though, is to account for ALL of the variables that your playbook needs. These either have to be specified in:

* your playbook role itself (in the code)
* in your Job Templates `Extra Variables` field
* in your Job Templates as a Survey

For this exercise, we will create a Job Template that will create local users on a given system. First, let's look at our playbook. For this we will be using link:https://github.com/ajacocks/Ansible/tree/master/rhel_host_config[`rhel_host_config`] section in our GitHub repo.

.playbook
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: setup rhel VM
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: true

  roles:
    - host_common
----

.host_common role tasks
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Add or remove user account
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    group: users
    home: /home/{{ item.name }}
    password: "$6$rounds=656000$3s/q6j43TVMvo82J$CSZt.mYCTFADfParJDxYeiOM/AlovGpc1idDtehmpau6zQ94CBrMfuxaNyXhdk/t.kpgOOTw.9sueGrRttJrL0"
    state: "{{ user_state }}"
    remove: yes
  with_items:
    - "{{ users }}"
  tags:
    - users

- name: Force user with default password to change password at next login
  command: chage -d 0 {{ item.name }}
  when: user_state == "present"
  with_items:
    - "{{ users }}"
  tags:
    - users

- name: Add or remove yum packages
  package:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: "{{ package_state }}"
    use: yum
  with_items:
    - "{{ package_list }}"
  tags:
    - packages

- name: create the /etc/motd file
  template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644
  tags:
    - motd
----

As we can see, the playbook calls the host_common role, and that role has several tasks that can be put together or seperated by their tags.

For this example exercise, we will create a job template that will add system users to our systems that will let us log in. Looking at the tasks with a `user` tag, we need to account for a few variables:

* users - a dictionary of users with a name value
* user_password - a password (encrypted)
* user_state - whether the specified user should be created, or removed

We will create a simple survey to handle all of this, along with prompting for our `Extra Variables` in the Job Template so we can dynamically create users for a given system or group of systems.

[TIP]
.Creation of Users via Job Template
====
* For the `NAME` field, input `add users studentX` where `X` is your student number
* The `JOB TYPE` is `Run`
* For `INVENTORY`, and `PROJECT`, pick the only selections available, specifically `ansible-ec2-instances` and `Lab-Project`
* Pick `ansible-ec2-instances` as the `MACHINE CREDENTIAL`
* In the `LIMIT` field, enter `tag_user_id_studentX`, where `X` is your student number
* Notice that the `JOB TAGS` field is referencing the `users` tag that is defined in the role. This way this Job will only execute those tasks.
* The user name is defined by the `users:` dictionary, in the `Extra Variables` section (shown below), and is automatically set to the user ID that you logged in to tower with.

[TIP]
.Survey Configuration
====
* Click the blue `EDIT SURVEY` button, and fill out the fields, as follows:
* `PROMPT` should be `USER STATE`, to indicate the creation or deletion of a user
* `ANSWER VARIABLE NAME` should be `user_state`, specifying that the answer provided is stored in that variable, which is referenced in the Job Template
* `ANSWER TYPE` is `Multiple Choice (single select)`, indicating that there are several possible selections, and only one should be selectable, at a time
* `DEFAULT ANSWER` should be `present`, causing the default behavior to be user creation
* Make sure that the `REQUIRED` checkbox is filled, indicating that the user has to fill out the form
* NOTE: make sure that you click the green `SAVE` button, which may require you to horizontally scroll to the right, after creating the form

[TIP]
.Once the job template and accompanying survey are completed and saved:
====
* Click the image:button_launch.png[Title="Launch Button"] (launch) button next to the `add users student1` (using your user name, instead of `student1`) template, in the `Job Templates` section, at the bottom of the screen.
* Select whether the user should be present, or absent.  For this example, choose `present`.
* Click the image:button_launch_text.png[Title="Text Launch Button"] button, to execute the job.
* You will be redirected to a job monitoring screen, like the figure, below:
